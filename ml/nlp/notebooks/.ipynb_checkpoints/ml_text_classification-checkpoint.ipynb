    "# Text Classification\n",
    "# -------------------\n",
    "# Definition:\n",
    "#   Text Classification is the processing of labeling or organizing text data into groups.\n",
    "#   It forms a fundamental part of Natural Language Processing. In the digital age that we\n",
    "#   live in we are surrounded by text on our social media accounts, in commercials, on websites, Ebooks, etc. \n",
    "#   Taken from: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/text-classification-in-nlp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text Classification features\n",
    "# 1. Your model can onky have two results: Either your model is correct or incorrect\n",
    "# 2. Raw text is converted into a vectorized version (ML doesn't really understand text).\n",
    "#    Imagine that a text has a vectorized form (like a matrix). There are many ways of transforming\n",
    "#    raw text into numerical information. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Some Applications of Text Classification:\n",
    "#   - Spam detection\n",
    "#   - Bot comments\n",
    "#   - Topic Labeling\n",
    "#   - Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes:\n",
    "# - Text classification is a topic of ML\n",
    "# - ML uses algorithms that iteratively learn from data\n",
    "# - A text classification system can be built based on Supervided Machine Learning"
